  <h1>What is this?</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my chess page. I recently started playing chess semi-competitvely, and am interested in examining openings from an analytical perspective. In chess, there are different ways to open the game that can determine what strategic direction the rest of the game will take. Players spend a lot of time studying the opening and trying to build a repertoire of opening moves that will give them an advantage going into the mid-game. More has been written about the opening then any other phase of the game, and lots of highly theoretical work has gone into trying to find the 'best' opening.</p>
  <p>One challenge for many players at the amateur level is that the top tier openings require a large amount of study, in order to keep up with the latest theory. It is not uncommon, at the grandmaster level, for games in the most studied openings to see 20-30 moves played effectively from a script before the 'over the board' thinking commences. For people who are not professional players and cannot devote massive amounts of time to chess, it is desirable to try and examine more obscure openings in the hope of bypassing much of that study, and, as an added bonus, potentially catching one's opponent in an unfamiliar position.</p>
  <p>However, there is a trade-off. The common wisdom is that the obscure openings are infrequently played for a reason, that reason being they are not very strong. As such, one has to weigh the benefit of picking an opening less frequently played against the negative of playing less theoretically sound moves. This project began as an attempt to do exactly that, to try and quantify and visualize this tradeoff of quality for quantity, and identify the most 'underplayed' openings in chess</p>
